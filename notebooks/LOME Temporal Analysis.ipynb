      "SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.--The mysterious, flulike illness from southern China known as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, has public health officials around the world on high alert, and international travelers are trying to decide whether to cancel trips to Asia or even parts of Canada, where a cluster of cases arose in the Toronto area.\n",
      "Trek brought reports that the spread of the disease seems to be leveling off, but as of this writing, the World Health Organization recommends against nonessential travel to Hong Kong and China's Guangdong province.\n",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's advisory includes all of mainland China, Singapore and Hanoi.\n",
      "Health officials in some other countries have also put Taiwan and Canada's Ontario province on the list.\n",
      "But with details and knowledge about the disease _ not to mention the number of new cases _ constantly changing, even the experts aren't always sure what to tell people.\n",
      "``It's hard to give specific advice,'' said Dr. Bradley A. Connor, medical director of the New York Center for Travel and Tropical Medicine and president-elect of the International Society of Travel Medicine.\n",
      "``All the information is not in yet.''\n",
      "Anxiety is spreading to parts of the world where SARS has not been shown to be a threat.\n",
      "Connor said a travel agent told a friend of his that she was advising all her clients to stay away from Australia, even though only one suspected case had been reported.\n",
      "(As of Thursday, Australia had reported three suspected cases.)\n",
      "``Even if there were more cases reported, I don't think that would put you in danger,'' Connor said.\n",
      "Many questions are about trips to Asian countries not named in travel advisories, such as Japan, South Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Mongolia, Tibet and Burma.Except for a single suspected case of SARS in Japan, none other cases have been reported in those countries as of this writing, and health officials say at this point there is no reason to curtail travel there.\n",
      "As of Thursday, Thailand had reported eight cases, but has also taken some extreme measures _ including turning away a French navy ship that had earlier docked in Hong Kong _ to keep it from spreading.\n",
      "``If the CDC and the WHO are not saying avoid travel to Thailand,'' Connor said, ``I wouldn't say so either.''\n",
      "Still, he said, ``It's hard to tell anyone what their risk is in a situation that is evolving and changing.\n",
      "We don't have a crystal ball to know where we will be two or three weeks from now.''\n",
      "Just over half of Connor's clients canceled or postponed international trips, not counting the many business travelers whose companies have grounded them.\n",
      "If you do have to travel to one of the affected areas, some common-sense precautions are in ordmr$Health officials suspect SARS is spread through droplets in the breath, coughs or sneezes of people with the disease.\n",
      "JuT$lacking a clear idea of the route of transmission, they say it is also possible the disease can spread by skin contact, clothing or recycled air in air conditioning systems.\n",
      "Dr.\n",
      "I. Dale Carroll, who runs the Web site travdoc.com, recommends avoiding crowds, taking cars or taxis instead of public transit, keeping rooms well-ventilated and washing hands frequently.\n",
      "If you do have to be in a crowd, wear a surgical mask or wrap a scarf around your nose and mouth.\n",
      "Many airlines are taking extra precautions to disinfect planes and be on the lookout for people who appear sick, especially on flights from affected areas.\n",
      "Studies have shown that recirculated air in plane cabins does not spread disease, but sitting near an infected person on a long trip might put you at risk.\n",
      "For some perspective, Connor points out, ``There have been nearly 3,000 cases, and there are several million people living and transiting through Hong Kong alone.\n",
      "So if you look at the chance of getting SARS, it is low.\n",
      "The chance of that (infected) somebody sitti,g next to you on an aircraft is even lower.''\n",
      "Carroll pointed out that 175,000 Americans will get common pneumococcal pneumonia this year andt.\n",
      "One major difference is that we know what causes common pneumonia and have treatments for it; SARS remains a mystery, although scientists are working furiously on tests and possible therapies.\n",
      "Here are the symptoms and conditions to look out for: Fever above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit Shaking and chills Harsh, dry cough or shortness of breath Symptoms occurring within 10 days of travel to an affected area or contact with an infected person If you are contemplating a trip to affected areas, consult with a travel medicine specialist who keeps up on the latest developments.\n",

      "It begins with the bite.\n",
      "She alights on your skin, a small, elegant, grayish mosquito with a distinctive, silvery-white lyre-shaped pattern on her back.\n",
      "She has small wings and fernlike antennae.\n",
      "Her Latin name is Aedes aegypti.\n",
      "As with all mosquitoes, only the female bites you.\n",
      "Nothing personal: She simply requires protein to produce her eggs and has evolved the equipment to procure it from your blood.\n",
      "Males live exclusively on nectar.\n",
      "Upon landing, she probes for a blood vessel, inserting her mouthparts into your skin a millimeter or two at a time, lubricating the motion with saliva, then pulling them back out.\n",
      "The motion is oddly reminiscent of fly-fishing, of dipping the rod in a cast and bringing it back.\n",
      "When she finds a blood vessel, she forces the tip of her proboscis through the skin and into the flow of the blood.\n",
      "She then simultaneously sucks out blood while continuing to dribble saliva.\n",
      "The walls of her proboscis are double-barreled, so saliva dribbles down one barrel while the blood is imbibed through the other.\n",
      "If she happens to be infected with a virus or a parasite, it will pass by way of the saliva to you.\n",
      "The bite is painless.\n",
      "If you are allergic to the saliva, the itching begins in about a minute, but the mosquito will probably be gone by then.\n",
      "If you are not allergic, you may never know you've been had.\n",
      "Aedes aegypti has evolved to bite you and get away alive.\n",
      "It is precisely that bite, and its implications for human disease, that prompted Paul Reiter, an entomologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to visit the central highlands of Puerto Rico several months ago.\n",
      "Reiter picked me up at my hotel at 6:30 on an already muggy morning to beat the rush-hour traffic out of San Juan, which we failed to do.\n",
      "We were headed for Florida, a small town about an hour's drive west of the capital.\n",
      "The CDC runs a laboratory in San Juan to keep track of Aedes aegypti and the diseases it causes, and there has been a lot to keep track of lately.\n",
      "The mosquito, long a bane in the Western hemisphere, has made a stealthy and disturbing comeback.\n",
      "For 200 years this one species brought devastating epidemics of urban yellow fever to the Americas, including significant outbreaks in New York and Philadelphia.\n",
      "The mosquito is also responsible for infecting about 100 million people each year with dengue (pronounced DEN-gee) fever, a severe flulike illness whose common name _ breakbone fever _ adverts to its excruciating pain.\n",
      "It infects another 200,000 to 500,000 people with dengue hemorrhagic fever, a potentially fatal form of dengue.\n",
      "To epidemiologists, the presence of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever is a harbinger of urban yellow-fever outbreaks to come.\n",
      "Dengue fever is now a constant presence in Puerto Rico, with occasional epidemic flare-ups.\n",
      "A small dengue epidemic swept through the town of Florida in 1991.\n",
      "Among its 8,900 inhabitants, 400 had been sick enough to need medical attention.\n",
      "Four had hemorrhagic fever, and one of those died.\n",
      "Reiter was making a series of visits to the town as part of an experiment to see if it were possible to block the dangerous traffic among viruses, mosquitoes and humans.\n",
      "As we drove out, Reiter, wearing a blue ``CDC at 50'' T-shirt, his curly brown hair in disarray, explained the gist of the mosquito problem, which was not, as you might think, that the insect has become better adapted to the modern world, but rather that the world has become much more accommodating to the mosquito.\n",
      "Aedes aegypti is a mosquito that has evolved to live in proximity to humans and to breed almost exclusively in man-made containers capable of holding stagnant water.\n",
      "Thus the detritus of late-20th-century civilization, all the junk and discards and certifiably nonbiodegradable material that have been liberally strewn throughout the world, now constitutes the ideal breeding site for the mosquito.\n",
      "While mankind has driven thousands of species on this planet toward extinction by destroying their habitats, there are a few, such as Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae, the primary carrier (or ``vector'') of malaria, for which we have done nothing but provide new habitats.\n",
      "If anything, we may have created a severe public-health crisis in the tropics.\n",
      "Despite a decades-long campaign to eradicate Aedes aegypti in this hemisphere, the mosquito has recolonized virtually every acre of its former breeding grounds.\n",
      "Of the 21 countries declared free of the mosquito in the 1960s, every last one has now become reinfested.\n",
      "What makes this especially significant is what Reiter calls the catch-22 of mosquito eradication.\n",
      "Once you embark upon it, you can never stop, or the threat to public health actually gets worse.\n",
      "The reason is an unfortunate variable known to epidemiologists as ``herd immunity'' _ the proportion of the population that has become immune to a virus such as dengue.\n",
      "Not everyone infected by the virus gets dengue symptoms, but everyone who has been infected develops immunity to the virus, and when a mosquito bites one of those people, it wastes precious bites that could otherwise be spreading the disease.\n",
      "This dilutes the force of the epidemic and eventually kills it off, since most of the populace becomes immune.\n",
      "The higher the herd immunity, the more mosquitoes necessary to start an epidemic.\n",
      "The lower the immunity, the fewer mosquitoes.\n",
      "Given the realities of herd immunity, you could argue that the worst possible public-health situation would be to eradicate a mosquito such as Aedes aegypti and then let it return.\n",
      "That is precisely what has happened in the Western hemisphere, and among the people who know it best, this particular insect is a formidable foe.\n",
      "``It's quite astonishing how resourceful the mosquito is,'' Reiter said, with a little wonder in his voice.\n",
      "From the human perspective, the insects (there are more than 3,000 species in the world) fall into two crude categories _ mere pests and real menaces _ and much of the distinction depends on where you live.\n",
      "Those of us who live in temperate climes deal with the mosquito as an annoyance, although the bother would be nearly unbearable were it not for prodigious amounts of mosquito control.\n",
      "Most of the state of Florida would be uninhabitable by modern standards without control measures, and so, for instance, would the south shore of Long Island or much of New Jersey, which earlier in the century was known unaffectionately as the ``Mosquito State.''\n",
      "In more tropical regions, the mosquito is considerably more than a nuisance.\n",
      "The danger is real and getting worse after several decades of ill-conceived eradication campaigns.\n",
      "While the diseases that make headlines these days are the freakish ``emerging'' viruses _ the hantavirus outbreak that killed 27 people in the Southwest in 1993 or the rare Ebola that killed 245 in 1995 in one small corner of the former Zaire _ mosquitoes transmit disease to at least 700 million people each year, about one-eighth of the world's population, and cause almost 3 million fatalities.\n",
      "In its World Health Report 1996, the World Health Organization labeled the mosquito the ``greatest menace'' of all disease-transmitting insects.\n",
      "Even that may understate the problem.\n",
      "Mosquitoes will kill, by WHO tally, roughly 1 in every 17 people currently alive on this planet.\n",
      "Perhaps 400 species of mosquito can transmit disease to humans.\n",
      "Malaria, for example, is carried by mosquitoes of the Anopheles family, of which some 60 species are reasonably competent vectors.\n",
      "One mosquito known colloquially as ``quinks'' (for Culex quinquefasciatus), which breeds in pit latrines, drainage ditches and any polluted water, spreads the filariasis worm that infects more than 100 million people, primarily in South Asia, the Pacific Islands and Africa.\n",
      "The parasite can cause either elephantiasis, in which the limbs become grossly swollen, or hydrocoele, in which the scrotum enlarges to gruesome proportions.\n",
      "Several species common to North America, including Culex tarsalis, transmit encephalitis viruses in the United States.\n",
      "These viruses _ in particular La Crosse encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis and Eastern and Western equine encephalitis _ circulate unseen in forest settings, passed between sylvan mosquitoes and the local birds or rodents, but they occasionally cause serious disease in children.\n",
      "A few dozen cases are reported each year to the CDC, with outbreaks every decade or so.\n",
      "In 1990, 250 people in Florida were struck with St. Louis encephalitis and 25 died.\n",
      "``The general perception is that mosquito-borne diseases ought to be eradicable,'' said Harold Varmus, director of the National Institutes of Health, ``and they have not proven to be so.\n",
      "And not only have the mosquitoes not been eradicated, but some of these diseases they carry are resurgent.\n",
      "They have come back from a fairly low ebb.''\n",
      "In response to this rebounding threat to public health, the National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization are planning a long-range research effort, while the World Bank is seeking support for a 30-year plan to battle malaria, but the obstacles strike many as nearly insurmountable.\n",
      "An effective malaria vaccine, long a goal, seems years away, and no one talks about trying to eliminate malaria-carrying mosquitoes anymore.\n",
      "Like Aedes aegypti, the Anopheles mosquito rapidly developed resistance to insecticides like DDT.\n",
      "Eradication, as one World Bank official said, ``has become a dirty word.''\n",
      "Aedes aegypti, meanwhile, has returned in a big way to this hemisphere, and brought disease back with it.\n",
      "Dengue is once again well-established throughout Latin America, and the number of cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever is creeping upward.\n",
      "The year 1995 was the worst on record for dengue fever in the Americas, and this summer there have already been epidemics in Mexico and Cuba.\n",
      "And while there haven't been epidemics of yellow fever in cities in this hemisphere in 50 years, tropical-disease experts are not so much warning of imminent outbreaks as wondering why they haven't yet occurred in places such as Caracas or Cali.\n",
      "``We now have in the American tropics several hundred million people who are susceptible to yellow fever,'' said Duane Gubler, who is the director of the division of vector-borne infectious diseases of the CDC.\n",
      "``All these areas are infested with Aedes aegypti, and so we're at the highest risk in over 50 years for urban epidemics of yellow fever.\n",
      "Once urban transmission begins in the American region, it's probably going to spread very rapidly throughout the region to other urban centers and then from there to Asia and the Pacific.''\n",
      "Yellow fever, sometimes known as the ``American plague,'' begins with fits of shivering, fever and thirst, rapidly progressing to furious headaches and joint pain and finally jaundice _ whence the ``yellow'' of its name.\n",
      "Despite the existence of a vaccine for yellow fever, public-health experts such as Gubler doubt that there is enough to handle an epidemic or that it could be distributed swiftly enough to blunt an outbreak.\n",
      "The odds of such an epidemic coming ``onshore,'' as experts refer to an outbreak in the United States, is considered remote.\n",
      "State and local governments spend roughly $200 million a year on mosquito control.\n",
      "(Suffolk County, N.Y., alone allocates $2 million to control its mosquito population, and Lee County, Fla., in the southwest corner of the state, budgets $9 million.)\n",
      "All of this, of course, would be ratcheted up considerably should any sign of serious disease develop.\n",
      "``They have two cases of St. Louis encephalitis in Florida,'' one entomologist said, not entirely in jest, ``and they dip the whole state in malathion.''\n",
      "Yet yellow fever or dengue, like malaria, is only a plane flight away from the United States.\n",
      "In the nightmare scenario, someone gets on a plane in, say, Sao Paulo infected with yellow fever but showing no symptoms and deplanes in Miami or any other city south of Atlanta, where Aedes aegypti is well established and can survive the winter.\n",
      "It is not nearly as unlikely as it may seem.\n",
      "``Last year,'' said Tom Monath, the former head of the CDC's insect-borne infectious-disease division, ``we had an unfortunate individual who went on a river trip in Brazil, got infected and came back and was hospitalized in Nashville and died at Vanderbilt.''\n",
      "All it takes is for an infected person to get bit by Aedes aegypti and the disease can begin to spread.\n",
      "It is a task for which this particular mosquito is exquisitely qualified.\n",
      "Eradication is the ultimate weapon against mosquitoes, but the immensity (not to say futility) of the effort is hard to comprehend.\n",
      "Despite all the scientific and technological advances of this past century, no one has improved on the method William Gorgas first applied in Havana in 1901.\n",
      "For centuries, Havana had been ravaged by yellow fever.\n",
      "Gorgas and his sanitation crews went house to house and building to building, getting rid of every potential mosquito breeding site for Aedes aegypti in the entire city.\n",
      "As Gorgas did it, the operation bordered on the paramilitary, which is the only way it has worked since then.\n",
      "In 1947, the Pan American Sanitary Bureau (predecessor of the Pan American Health Organization) decided that a hemisphere-wide eradication campaign was the only way to put an end to the urban yellow fever epidemics that still devastated Latin America.\n",
      "By 1962, at the peak of the program and with liberal use of DDT, 18 nations were officially free of Aedes aegypti.\n",
      "Three more nations eventually accomplished the feat, but there were some notable failures, in particular the United States, where the mosquito infested virtually every southern state.\n",
      "The failure of the program was as much political as scientific.\n",
      "Mosquito-control experts complained at the time that Congress budgeted too little to accomplish the task.\n",
      "Donald Schliessmann, who directed the CDC's efforts, described the allocation as ``equivalent to instructions to fly across the Atlantic with half a tank of gas.''\n",
      "With such tepid support in the United States, the Pan American Health Organization's eradication program promptly died and the mosquito had little trouble recolonizing its former haunts.\n",
      "Its return has inevitably been followed by the return of dengue fever, which has experts at the CDC and PAHO worried for three distinct reasons.\n",
      "First, unlike the case of yellow fever, there is no vaccine for dengue, which means that the only defense for locals or travelers, as one CDC entomologist bluntly put it, is not to get bit.\n",
      "Second, dengue epidemics are explosive.\n",
      "``The first time a country has an epidemic, it is usually in the capital city, and you can have 30 to 60 percent of the people all sick at the same time,'' Mike Nelson, a PAHO entomologist, informed me.\n",
      "A 1986-87 epidemic in Rio de Janeiro tallied one million cases.\n",
      "In 1988, dengue hit Guayaquil, Ecuador, with some 450,000 cases in four months.\n",
      "Most troubling to PAHO experts is the potentially fatal hemorrhagic manifestation of dengue.\n",
      "Researchers have identified four separate ``serotypes,'' or variants, of the dengue virus (known, unimaginatively, as dengue-1 through dengue-4).\n",

      "It begins with the bite.\n",
      "She alights on your skin, a small, elegant, grayish mosquito with a distinctive, silvery-white lyre-shaped pattern on her back.\n",
      "She has small wings and fernlike antennae.\n",
      "Her Latin name is Aedes aegypti.\n",
      "As with all mosquitoes, only the female bites you.\n",
      "Nothing personal: She simply requires protein to produce her eggs and has evolved the equipment to procure it from your blood.\n",
      "Males live exclusively on nectar.\n",
      "Upon landing, she probes for a blood vessel, inserting her mouthparts into your skin a millimeter or two at a time, lubricating the motion with saliva, then pulling them back out.\n",
      "The motion is oddly reminiscent of fly-fishing, of dipping the rod in a cast and bringing it back.\n",
      "When she finds a blood vessel, she forces the tip of her proboscis through the skin and into the flow of the blood.\n",
      "She then simultaneously sucks out blood while continuing to dribble saliva.\n",
      "The walls of her proboscis are double-barreled, so saliva dribbles down one barrel while the blood is imbibed through the other.\n",
      "If she happens to be infected with a virus or a parasite, it will pass by way of the saliva to you.\n",
      "The bite is painless.\n",
      "If you are allergic to the saliva, the itching begins in about a minute, but the mosquito will probably be gone by then.\n",
      "If you are not allergic, you may never know you've been had.\n",
      "Aedes aegypti has evolved to bite you and get away alive.\n",
      "It is precisely that bite, and its implications for human disease, that prompted Paul Reiter, an entomologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to visit the central highlands of Puerto Rico several months ago.\n",
      "Reiter picked me up at my hotel at 6:30 on an already muggy morning to beat the rush-hour traffic out of San Juan, which we failed to do.\n",
      "We were headed for Florida, a small town about an hour's drive west of the capital.\n",
      "The CDC runs a laboratory in San Juan to keep track of Aedes aegypti and the diseases it causes, and there has been a lot to keep track of lately.\n",
      "The mosquito, long a bane in the Western hemisphere, has made a stealthy and disturbing comeback.\n",
      "For 200 years this one species brought devastating epidemics of urban yellow fever to the Americas, including significant outbreaks in New York and Philadelphia.\n",
      "The mosquito is also responsible for infecting about 100 million people each year with dengue (pronounced DEN-gee) fever, a severe flulike illness whose common name _ breakbone fever _ adverts to its excruciating pain.\n",
      "It infects another 200,000 to 500,000 people with dengue hemorrhagic fever, a potentially fatal form of dengue.\n",
      "To epidemiologists, the presence of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever is a harbinger of urban yellow-fever outbreaks to come.\n",
      "Dengue fever is now a constant presence in Puerto Rico, with occasional epidemic flare-ups.\n",
      "A small dengue epidemic swept through the town of Florida in 1991.\n",
      "Among its 8,900 inhabitants, 400 had been sick enough to need medical attention.\n",
      "Four had hemorrhagic fever, and one of those died.\n",
      "Reiter was making a series of visits to the town as part of an experiment to see if it were possible to block the dangerous traffic among viruses, mosquitoes and humans.\n",
      "As we drove out, Reiter, wearing a blue ``CDC at 50'' T-shirt, his curly brown hair in disarray, explained the gist of the mosquito problem, which was not, as you might think, that the insect has become better adapted to the modern world, but rather that the world has become much more accommodating to the mosquito.\n",
      "Aedes aegypti is a mosquito that has evolved to live in proximity to humans and to breed almost exclusively in man-made containers capable of holding stagnant water.\n",
      "Thus the detritus of late-20th-century civilization, all the junk and discards and certifiably nonbiodegradable material that have been liberally strewn throughout the world, now constitutes the ideal breeding site for the mosquito.\n",
      "While mankind has driven thousands of species on this planet toward extinction by destroying their habitats, there are a few, such as Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae, the primary carrier (or ``vector'') of malaria, for which we have done nothing but provide new habitats.\n",
      "If anything, we may have created a severe public-health crisis in the tropics.\n",
      "Despite a decades-long campaign to eradicate Aedes aegypti in this hemisphere, the mosquito has recolonized virtually every acre of its former breeding grounds.\n",
      "Of the 21 countries declared free of the mosquito in the 1960s, every last one has now become reinfested.\n",
      "What makes this especially significant is what Reiter calls the catch-22 of mosquito eradication.\n",
      "Once you embark upon it, you can never stop, or the threat to public health actually gets worse.\n",
      "The reason is an unfortunate variable known to epidemiologists as ``herd immunity'' _ the proportion of the population that has become immune to a virus such as dengue.\n",
      "Not everyone infected by the virus gets dengue symptoms, but everyone who has been infected develops immunity to the virus, and when a mosquito bites one of those people, it wastes precious bites that could otherwise be spreading the disease.\n",
      "This dilutes the force of the epidemic and eventually kills it off, since most of the populace becomes immune.\n",
      "The higher the herd immunity, the more mosquitoes necessary to start an epidemic.\n",
      "The lower the immunity, the fewer mosquitoes.\n",
      "Given the realities of herd immunity, you could argue that the worst possible public-health situation would be to eradicate a mosquito such as Aedes aegypti and then let it return.\n",
      "That is precisely what has happened in the Western hemisphere, and among the people who know it best, this particular insect is a formidable foe.\n",
      "``It's quite astonishing how resourceful the mosquito is,'' Reiter said, with a little wonder in his voice.\n",
      "From the human perspective, the insects (there are more than 3,000 species in the world) fall into two crude categories _ mere pests and real menaces _ and much of the distinction depends on where you live.\n",
      "Those of us who live in temperate climes deal with the mosquito as an annoyance, although the bother would be nearly unbearable were it not for prodigious amounts of mosquito control.\n",
      "Most of the state of Florida would be uninhabitable by modern standards without control measures, and so, for instance, would the south shore of Long Island or much of New Jersey, which earlier in the century was known unaffectionately as the ``Mosquito State.''\n",
      "In more tropical regions, the mosquito is considerably more than a nuisance.\n",
      "The danger is real and getting worse after several decades of ill-conceived eradication campaigns.\n",
      "While the diseases that make headlines these days are the freakish ``emerging'' viruses _ the hantavirus outbreak that killed 27 people in the Southwest in 1993 or the rare Ebola that killed 245 in 1995 in one small corner of the former Zaire _ mosquitoes transmit disease to at least 700 million people each year, about one-eighth of the world's population, and cause almost 3 million fatalities.\n",
      "In its World Health Report 1996, the World Health Organization labeled the mosquito the ``greatest menace'' of all disease-transmitting insects.\n",
      "Even that may understate the problem.\n",
      "Mosquitoes will kill, by WHO tally, roughly 1 in every 17 people currently alive on this planet.\n",
      "Perhaps 400 species of mosquito can transmit disease to humans.\n",
      "Malaria, for example, is carried by mosquitoes of the Anopheles family, of which some 60 species are reasonably competent vectors.\n",
      "One mosquito known colloquially as ``quinks'' (for Culex quinquefasciatus), which breeds in pit latrines, drainage ditches and any polluted water, spreads the filariasis worm that infects more than 100 million people, primarily in South Asia, the Pacific Islands and Africa.\n",
      "The parasite can cause either elephantiasis, in which the limbs become grossly swollen, or hydrocoele, in which the scrotum enlarges to gruesome proportions.\n",
      "Several species common to North America, including Culex tarsalis, transmit encephalitis viruses in the United States.\n",
      "These viruses _ in particular La Crosse encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis and Eastern and Western equine encephalitis _ circulate unseen in forest settings, passed between sylvan mosquitoes and the local birds or rodents, but they occasionally cause serious disease in children.\n",
      "A few dozen cases are reported each year to the CDC, with outbreaks every decade or so.\n",
      "In 1990, 250 people in Florida were struck with St. Louis encephalitis and 25 died.\n",
      "``The general perception is that mosquito-borne diseases ought to be eradicable,'' said Harold Varmus, director of the National Institutes of Health, ``and they have not proven to be so.\n",
      "And not only have the mosquitoes not been eradicated, but some of these diseases they carry are resurgent.\n",
      "They have come back from a fairly low ebb.''\n",
      "In response to this rebounding threat to public health, the National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization are planning a long-range research effort, while the World Bank is seeking support for a 30-year plan to battle malaria, but the obstacles strike many as nearly insurmountable.\n",
      "An effective malaria vaccine, long a goal, seems years away, and no one talks about trying to eliminate malaria-carrying mosquitoes anymore.\n",
      "Like Aedes aegypti, the Anopheles mosquito rapidly developed resistance to insecticides like DDT.\n",
      "Eradication, as one World Bank official said, ``has become a dirty word.''\n",
      "Aedes aegypti, meanwhile, has returned in a big way to this hemisphere, and brought disease back with it.\n",
      "Dengue is once again well-established throughout Latin America, and the number of cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever is creeping upward.\n",
      "The year 1995 was the worst on record for dengue fever in the Americas, and this summer there have already been epidemics in Mexico and Cuba.\n",
      "And while there haven't been epidemics of yellow fever in cities in this hemisphere in 50 years, tropical-disease experts are not so much warning of imminent outbreaks as wondering why they haven't yet occurred in places such as Caracas or Cali.\n",
      "``We now have in the American tropics several hundred million people who are susceptible to yellow fever,'' said Duane Gubler, who is the director of the division of vector-borne infectious diseases of the CDC.\n",
      "``All these areas are infested with Aedes aegypti, and so we're at the highest risk in over 50 years for urban epidemics of yellow fever.\n",
      "Once urban transmission begins in the American region, it's probably going to spread very rapidly throughout the region to other urban centers and then from there to Asia and the Pacific.''\n",
      "Yellow fever, sometimes known as the ``American plague,'' begins with fits of shivering, fever and thirst, rapidly progressing to furious headaches and joint pain and finally jaundice _ whence the ``yellow'' of its name.\n",
      "Despite the existence of a vaccine for yellow fever, public-health experts such as Gubler doubt that there is enough to handle an epidemic or that it could be distributed swiftly enough to blunt an outbreak.\n",
      "The odds of such an epidemic coming ``onshore,'' as experts refer to an outbreak in the United States, is considered remote.\n",
      "State and local governments spend roughly $200 million a year on mosquito control.\n",
      "(Suffolk County, N.Y., alone allocates $2 million to control its mosquito population, and Lee County, Fla., in the southwest corner of the state, budgets $9 million.)\n",
      "All of this, of course, would be ratcheted up considerably should any sign of serious disease develop.\n",
      "``They have two cases of St. Louis encephalitis in Florida,'' one entomologist said, not entirely in jest, ``and they dip the whole state in malathion.''\n",
      "Yet yellow fever or dengue, like malaria, is only a plane flight away from the United States.\n",
      "In the nightmare scenario, someone gets on a plane in, say, Sao Paulo infected with yellow fever but showing no symptoms and deplanes in Miami or any other city south of Atlanta, where Aedes aegypti is well established and can survive the winter.\n",
      "It is not nearly as unlikely as it may seem.\n",
      "``Last year,'' said Tom Monath, the former head of the CDC's insect-borne infectious-disease division, ``we had an unfortunate individual who went on a river trip in Brazil, got infected and came back and was hospitalized in Nashville and died at Vanderbilt.''\n",
      "All it takes is for an infected person to get bit by Aedes aegypti and the disease can begin to spread.\n",
      "It is a task for which this particular mosquito is exquisitely qualified.\n",
      "Eradication is the ultimate weapon against mosquitoes, but the immensity (not to say futility) of the effort is hard to comprehend.\n",
      "Despite all the scientific and technological advances of this past century, no one has improved on the method William Gorgas first applied in Havana in 1901.\n",
      "For centuries, Havana had been ravaged by yellow fever.\n",
      "Gorgas and his sanitation crews went house to house and building to building, getting rid of every potential mosquito breeding site for Aedes aegypti in the entire city.\n",
      "As Gorgas did it, the operation bordered on the paramilitary, which is the only way it has worked since then.\n",
      "In 1947, the Pan American Sanitary Bureau (predecessor of the Pan American Health Organization) decided that a hemisphere-wide eradication campaign was the only way to put an end to the urban yellow fever epidemics that still devastated Latin America.\n",
      "By 1962, at the peak of the program and with liberal use of DDT, 18 nations were officially free of Aedes aegypti.\n",
      "Three more nations eventually accomplished the feat, but there were some notable failures, in particular the United States, where the mosquito infested virtually every southern state.\n",
      "The failure of the program was as much political as scientific.\n",
      "Mosquito-control experts complained at the time that Congress budgeted too little to accomplish the task.\n",
      "Donald Schliessmann, who directed the CDC's efforts, described the allocation as ``equivalent to instructions to fly across the Atlantic with half a tank of gas.''\n",
      "With such tepid support in the United States, the Pan American Health Organization's eradication program promptly died and the mosquito had little trouble recolonizing its former haunts.\n",
      "Its return has inevitably been followed by the return of dengue fever, which has experts at the CDC and PAHO worried for three distinct reasons.\n",
      "First, unlike the case of yellow fever, there is no vaccine for dengue, which means that the only defense for locals or travelers, as one CDC entomologist bluntly put it, is not to get bit.\n",
      "Second, dengue epidemics are explosive.\n",
      "``The first time a country has an epidemic, it is usually in the capital city, and you can have 30 to 60 percent of the people all sick at the same time,'' Mike Nelson, a PAHO entomologist, informed me.\n",
      "A 1986-87 epidemic in Rio de Janeiro tallied one million cases.\n",
      "In 1988, dengue hit Guayaquil, Ecuador, with some 450,000 cases in four months.\n",
      "Most troubling to PAHO experts is the potentially fatal hemorrhagic manifestation of dengue.\n",
      "Researchers have identified four separate ``serotypes,'' or variants, of the dengue virus (known, unimaginatively, as dengue-1 through dengue-4).\n",
      "A first infection can bring on dengue fever.\n",
      "Subsequent infections with other serotypes are then likely to produce dengue hemorrhagic fever, which can lead to massive hemorrhaging or circulatory collapse.\n",
      "The first major appearance of dengue hemorrhagic fever in the Western Hemisphere occurred in 1981 during a Cuban epidemic: There were 300,000 cases of dengue and 10,000 cases of hemorrhagic fever with 158 deaths.\n",
      "Smaller outbreaks of dengue hemorrhagic fever appeared in Venezuela in 1989-90 and in Rio de Janeiro in 1990.\n",
      "The numbers have been climbing steadily.\n",
      "In Mexico, for example, there were 26 reported cases in the entire decade prior to 1994.\n",

      "Aedes aegypti has evolved to bite you and get away alive.\n",
      "It is precisely that bite, and its implications for human disease, that prompted Paul Reiter, an entomologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to visit the central highlands of Puerto Rico several months ago.\n",
      "Reiter picked me up at my hotel at 6:30 on an already muggy morning to beat the rush-hour traffic out of San Juan, which we failed to do.\n",
      "We were headed for Florida, a small town about an hour's drive west of the capital.\n",
      "The CDC runs a laboratory in San Juan to keep track of Aedes aegypti and the diseases it causes, and there has been a lot to keep track of lately.\n",
      "The mosquito, long a bane in the Western hemisphere, has made a stealthy and disturbing comeback.\n",
      "For 200 years this one species brought devastating epidemics of urban yellow fever to the Americas, including significant outbreaks in New York and Philadelphia.\n",
      "The mosquito is also responsible for infecting about 100 million people each year with dengue (pronounced DEN-gee) fever, a severe flulike illness whose common name _ breakbone fever _ adverts to its excruciating pain.\n",
      "It infects another 200,000 to 500,000 people with dengue hemorrhagic fever, a potentially fatal form of dengue.\n",
      "To epidemiologists, the presence of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever is a harbinger of urban yellow-fever outbreaks to come.\n",
      "Dengue fever is now a constant presence in Puerto Rico, with occasional epidemic flare-ups.\n",
      "A small dengue epidemic swept through the town of Florida in 1991.\n",
      "Among its 8,900 inhabitants, 400 had been sick enough to need medical attention.\n",
      "Four had hemorrhagic fever, and one of those died.\n",
      "Reiter was making a series of visits to the town as part of an experiment to see if it were possible to block the dangerous traffic among viruses, mosquitoes and humans.\n",
      "As we drove out, Reiter, wearing a blue ``CDC at 50'' T-shirt, his curly brown hair in disarray, explained the gist of the mosquito problem, which was not, as you might think, that the insect has become better adapted to the modern world, but rather that the world has become much more accommodating to the mosquito.\n",
      "Aedes aegypti is a mosquito that has evolved to live in proximity to humans and to breed almost exclusively in man-made containers capable of holding stagnant water.\n",
      "Thus the detritus of late-20th-century civilization, all the junk and discards and certifiably nonbiodegradable material that have been liberally strewn throughout the world, now constitutes the ideal breeding site for the mosquito.\n",
      "While mankind has driven thousands of species on this planet toward extinction by destroying their habitats, there are a few, such as Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae, the primary carrier (or ``vector'') of malaria, for which we have done nothing but provide new habitats.\n",
      "If anything, we may have created a severe public-health crisis in the tropics.\n",
      "Despite a decades-long campaign to eradicate Aedes aegypti in this hemisphere, the mosquito has recolonized virtually every acre of its former breeding grounds.\n",
      "Of the 21 countries declared free of the mosquito in the 1960s, every last one has now become reinfested.\n",
      "What makes this especially significant is what Reiter calls the catch-22 of mosquito eradication.\n",
      "Once you embark upon it, you can never stop, or the threat to public health actually gets worse.\n",
      "The reason is an unfortunate variable known to epidemiologists as ``herd immunity'' _ the proportion of the population that has become immune to a virus such as dengue.\n",
      "Not everyone infected by the virus gets dengue symptoms, but everyone who has been infected develops immunity to the virus, and when a mosquito bites one of those people, it wastes precious bites that could otherwise be spreading the disease.\n",
      "This dilutes the force of the epidemic and eventually kills it off, since most of the populace becomes immune.\n",
      "The higher the herd immunity, the more mosquitoes necessary to start an epidemic.\n",
      "The lower the immunity, the fewer mosquitoes.\n",
      "Given the realities of herd immunity, you could argue that the worst possible public-health situation would be to eradicate a mosquito such as Aedes aegypti and then let it return.\n",
      "That is precisely what has happened in the Western hemisphere, and among the people who know it best, this particular insect is a formidable foe.\n",
      "``It's quite astonishing how resourceful the mosquito is,'' Reiter said, with a little wonder in his voice.\n",
      "From the human perspective, the insects (there are more than 3,000 species in the world) fall into two crude categories _ mere pests and real menaces _ and much of the distinction depends on where you live.\n",
      "Those of us who live in temperate climes deal with the mosquito as an annoyance, although the bother would be nearly unbearable were it not for prodigious amounts of mosquito control.\n",
      "Most of the state of Florida would be uninhabitable by modern standards without control measures, and so, for instance, would the south shore of Long Island or much of New Jersey, which earlier in the century was known unaffectionately as the ``Mosquito State.''\n",
      "In more tropical regions, the mosquito is considerably more than a nuisance.\n",
      "The danger is real and getting worse after several decades of ill-conceived eradication campaigns.\n",
      "While the diseases that make headlines these days are the freakish ``emerging'' viruses _ the hantavirus outbreak that killed 27 people in the Southwest in 1993 or the rare Ebola that killed 245 in 1995 in one small corner of the former Zaire _ mosquitoes transmit disease to at least 700 million people each year, about one-eighth of the world's population, and cause almost 3 million fatalities.\n",
      "In its World Health Report 1996, the World Health Organization labeled the mosquito the ``greatest menace'' of all disease-transmitting insects.\n",
      "Even that may understate the problem.\n",
      "Mosquitoes will kill, by WHO tally, roughly 1 in every 17 people currently alive on this planet.\n",
      "Perhaps 400 species of mosquito can transmit disease to humans.\n",
      "Malaria, for example, is carried by mosquitoes of the Anopheles family, of which some 60 species are reasonably competent vectors.\n",
      "One mosquito known colloquially as ``quinks'' (for Culex quinquefasciatus), which breeds in pit latrines, drainage ditches and any polluted water, spreads the filariasis worm that infects more than 100 million people, primarily in South Asia, the Pacific Islands and Africa.\n",
      "The parasite can cause either elephantiasis, in which the limbs become grossly swollen, or hydrocoele, in which the scrotum enlarges to gruesome proportions.\n",
      "Several species common to North America, including Culex tarsalis, transmit encephalitis viruses in the United States.\n",
      "These viruses _ in particular La Crosse encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis and Eastern and Western equine encephalitis _ circulate unseen in forest settings, passed between sylvan mosquitoes and the local birds or rodents, but they occasionally cause serious disease in children.\n",
      "A few dozen cases are reported each year to the CDC, with outbreaks every decade or so.\n",
      "In 1990, 250 people in Florida were struck with St. Louis encephalitis and 25 died.\n",
      "``The general perception is that mosquito-borne diseases ought to be eradicable,'' said Harold Varmus, director of the National Institutes of Health, ``and they have not proven to be so.\n",
      "And not only have the mosquitoes not been eradicated, but some of these diseases they carry are resurgent.\n",
      "They have come back from a fairly low ebb.''\n",
      "In response to this rebounding threat to public health, the National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization are planning a long-range research effort, while the World Bank is seeking support for a 30-year plan to battle malaria, but the obstacles strike many as nearly insurmountable.\n",
      "An effective malaria vaccine, long a goal, seems years away, and no one talks about trying to eliminate malaria-carrying mosquitoes anymore.\n",
      "Like Aedes aegypti, the Anopheles mosquito rapidly developed resistance to insecticides like DDT.\n",
      "Eradication, as one World Bank official said, ``has become a dirty word.''\n",
      "Aedes aegypti, meanwhile, has returned in a big way to this hemisphere, and brought disease back with it.\n",
      "Dengue is once again well-established throughout Latin America, and the number of cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever is creeping upward.\n",
      "The year 1995 was the worst on record for dengue fever in the Americas, and this summer there have already been epidemics in Mexico and Cuba.\n",
      "And while there haven't been epidemics of yellow fever in cities in this hemisphere in 50 years, tropical-disease experts are not so much warning of imminent outbreaks as wondering why they haven't yet occurred in places such as Caracas or Cali.\n",
      "``We now have in the American tropics several hundred million people who are susceptible to yellow fever,'' said Duane Gubler, who is the director of the division of vector-borne infectious diseases of the CDC.\n",
      "``All these areas are infested with Aedes aegypti, and so we're at the highest risk in over 50 years for urban epidemics of yellow fever.\n",
      "Once urban transmission begins in the American region, it's probably going to spread very rapidly throughout the region to other urban centers and then from there to Asia and the Pacific.''\n",
      "Yellow fever, sometimes known as the ``American plague,'' begins with fits of shivering, fever and thirst, rapidly progressing to furious headaches and joint pain and finally jaundice _ whence the ``yellow'' of its name.\n",
      "Despite the existence of a vaccine for yellow fever, public-health experts such as Gubler doubt that there is enough to handle an epidemic or that it could be distributed swiftly enough to blunt an outbreak.\n",
      "The odds of such an epidemic coming ``onshore,'' as experts refer to an outbreak in the United States, is considered remote.\n",
      "State and local governments spend roughly $200 million a year on mosquito control.\n",
      "(Suffolk County, N.Y., alone allocates $2 million to control its mosquito population, and Lee County, Fla., in the southwest corner of the state, budgets $9 million.)\n",
      "All of this, of course, would be ratcheted up considerably should any sign of serious disease develop.\n",
      "``They have two cases of St. Louis encephalitis in Florida,'' one entomologist said, not entirely in jest, ``and they dip the whole state in malathion.''\n",
      "Yet yellow fever or dengue, like malaria, is only a plane flight away from the United States.\n",
      "In the nightmare scenario, someone gets on a plane in, say, Sao Paulo infected with yellow fever but showing no symptoms and deplanes in Miami or any other city south of Atlanta, where Aedes aegypti is well established and can survive the winter.\n",
      "It is not nearly as unlikely as it may seem.\n",
      "``Last year,'' said Tom Monath, the former head of the CDC's insect-borne infectious-disease division, ``we had an unfortunate individual who went on a river trip in Brazil, got infected and came back and was hospitalized in Nashville and died at Vanderbilt.''\n",
      "All it takes is for an infected person to get bit by Aedes aegypti and the disease can begin to spread.\n",
      "It is a task for which this particular mosquito is exquisitely qualified.\n",
      "Eradication is the ultimate weapon against mosquitoes, but the immensity (not to say futility) of the effort is hard to comprehend.\n",
      "Despite all the scientific and technological advances of this past century, no one has improved on the method William Gorgas first applied in Havana in 1901.\n",
      "For centuries, Havana had been ravaged by yellow fever.\n",
      "Gorgas and his sanitation crews went house to house and building to building, getting rid of every potential mosquito breeding site for Aedes aegypti in the entire city.\n",
      "As Gorgas did it, the operation bordered on the paramilitary, which is the only way it has worked since then.\n",
      "In 1947, the Pan American Sanitary Bureau (predecessor of the Pan American Health Organization) decided that a hemisphere-wide eradication campaign was the only way to put an end to the urban yellow fever epidemics that still devastated Latin America.\n",
      "By 1962, at the peak of the program and with liberal use of DDT, 18 nations were officially free of Aedes aegypti.\n",
      "Three more nations eventually accomplished the feat, but there were some notable failures, in particular the United States, where the mosquito infested virtually every southern state.\n",
      "The failure of the program was as much political as scientific.\n",
      "Mosquito-control experts complained at the time that Congress budgeted too little to accomplish the task.\n",
      "Donald Schliessmann, who directed the CDC's efforts, described the allocation as ``equivalent to instructions to fly across the Atlantic with half a tank of gas.''\n",
      "With such tepid support in the United States, the Pan American Health Organization's eradication program promptly died and the mosquito had little trouble recolonizing its former haunts.\n",
      "Its return has inevitably been followed by the return of dengue fever, which has experts at the CDC and PAHO worried for three distinct reasons.\n",
      "First, unlike the case of yellow fever, there is no vaccine for dengue, which means that the only defense for locals or travelers, as one CDC entomologist bluntly put it, is not to get bit.\n",
      "Second, dengue epidemics are explosive.\n",
      "``The first time a country has an epidemic, it is usually in the capital city, and you can have 30 to 60 percent of the people all sick at the same time,'' Mike Nelson, a PAHO entomologist, informed me.\n",
      "A 1986-87 epidemic in Rio de Janeiro tallied one million cases.\n",
      "In 1988, dengue hit Guayaquil, Ecuador, with some 450,000 cases in four months.\n",
      "Most troubling to PAHO experts is the potentially fatal hemorrhagic manifestation of dengue.\n",
      "Researchers have identified four separate ``serotypes,'' or variants, of the dengue virus (known, unimaginatively, as dengue-1 through dengue-4).\n",
      "A first infection can bring on dengue fever.\n",
      "Subsequent infections with other serotypes are then likely to produce dengue hemorrhagic fever, which can lead to massive hemorrhaging or circulatory collapse.\n",
      "The first major appearance of dengue hemorrhagic fever in the Western Hemisphere occurred in 1981 during a Cuban epidemic: There were 300,000 cases of dengue and 10,000 cases of hemorrhagic fever with 158 deaths.\n",
      "Smaller outbreaks of dengue hemorrhagic fever appeared in Venezuela in 1989-90 and in Rio de Janeiro in 1990.\n",
      "The numbers have been climbing steadily.\n",
      "In Mexico, for example, there were 26 reported cases in the entire decade prior to 1994.\n",
      "In 1994 alone there were 30 cases, and in 1995 there were 92.\n",
      "To date, the problem in this hemisphere is predominantly a Latin American one, and is likely to remain so, but experts predict that the numbers of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever cases will continue to grow.\n",
      "Meanwhile, urban yellow fever is a ``modern-day time bomb,'' Gubler said.\n",
      "``We're just sitting here waiting for it to happen.''\n",
      "With all the renewed concern, the Pan American Health Organization is once again talking about eradication _ or, rather, what it calls ``amplification and intensification of combat.''\n",
      "PAHO officials met in April in Caracas and came up with a five-step plan.\n",
      "Each step, if approved, will successively lower the infestation levels until transmission of the disease is entirely interrupted.\n",
      "Only then will they go on to eradication, if it is necessary and considered remotely possible.\n",
      "While PAHO is leaving the door open for eradication, none of the entomologists with whom I spoke believe it is still possible.\n",
      "Between the garbage of modern times and the ease of reinfestation, they suggested, the job has probably become undoable at any cost.\n",
      "``There was probably a chance to eradicate Aedes aegypti in the '40s, '50s and '60s,'' said Tom Monath, the former CDC official.\n",
      "``But at this point in time, the war is lost.''\n",
      "If the small town of Florida is any indication, it is easy to understand why the smart money is on mosquitoes.\n",
      "Reiter took me on a tour through one neighborhood _ no shantytown but a middle-class housing development.\n",
      "Most of the homes were brightly painted, with nice Japanese and American cars in the carports.\n",
      "We went climbing through backyards, looking in carports, peering amid the tropical flowers, looking for breeding sites.\n",
      "They weren't hard to find.\n",
      "It was in a carport that I saw my first mosquito larvae.\n",
      "Reiter had to point them out to me.\n",
      "All I saw was an empty plastic SAE-40 oil bottle floating in five inches of water, along with a few rubber balls and an orange plastic Halloween pumpkin.\n",
      "Finally, Reiter directed my attention to the larvae, which were nearly invisible, S-shaped, thin and brown and flitting frenetically.\n",
      "Their nontechnical name is ``wrigglers,'' and that's exactly what they were doing.\n",
      "In a children's plastic wading pool.\n",
      "In the two hours I spent with Reiter and his colleagues, in a locale where every breeding site had been eliminated two months earlier, we found 23 newly infected breeding sites scattered among 16 houses.\n",
      "We found Aedes aegypti larvae in children's toys and soda cans, plastic cups and discarded automobile tires.\n",
      "We also found pupae, the next step up in mosquito development.\n",
      "In two or three days, Reiter pointed out, they would emerge as adults.\n",
      "``We're looking at something like 5 mosquitoes per human,'' he said, ``maybe 20 female mosquitoes per home.''\n",
      "The numbers have been debated, but for a viable epidemic, one infected breeding site in those 16 houses would have been more than enough.\n",
      "The implications are obvious.\n",
      "``Where you have successful control,'' Reiter said, ``and then you cease and you have a population that's largely susceptible, then you can have a rip-roaring epidemic and perhaps terrible tragedy.''\n",
      "``Is it possible to eradicate this species?''\n",
      "Reiter asked me rhetorically.\n",
      "``How can you possibly imagine you can eradicate a species as successful as aegypti?\n",
      "You could eradicate smallpox, because you eliminated its environment by vaccinating people.\n",
      "So that in the end there wasn't any habitat for the virus.\n",
      "But there's habitat for Aedes aegypti every time it rains.''\n",

      "The year 1995 was the worst on record for dengue fever in the Americas, and this summer there have already been epidemics in Mexico and Cuba.\n",
      "And while there haven't been epidemics of yellow fever in cities in this hemisphere in 50 years, tropical-disease experts are not so much warning of imminent outbreaks as wondering why they haven't yet occurred in places such as Caracas or Cali.\n",
      "``We now have in the American tropics several hundred million people who are susceptible to yellow fever,'' said Duane Gubler, who is the director of the division of vector-borne infectious diseases of the CDC.\n",
      "``All these areas are infested with Aedes aegypti, and so we're at the highest risk in over 50 years for urban epidemics of yellow fever.\n",
      "Once urban transmission begins in the American region, it's probably going to spread very rapidly throughout the region to other urban centers and then from there to Asia and the Pacific.''\n",
      "Yellow fever, sometimes known as the ``American plague,'' begins with fits of shivering, fever and thirst, rapidly progressing to furious headaches and joint pain and finally jaundice _ whence the ``yellow'' of its name.\n",
      "Despite the existence of a vaccine for yellow fever, public-health experts such as Gubler doubt that there is enough to handle an epidemic or that it could be distributed swiftly enough to blunt an outbreak.\n",
      "The odds of such an epidemic coming ``onshore,'' as experts refer to an outbreak in the United States, is considered remote.\n",
      "State and local governments spend roughly $200 million a year on mosquito control.\n",
      "(Suffolk County, N.Y., alone allocates $2 million to control its mosquito population, and Lee County, Fla., in the southwest corner of the state, budgets $9 million.)\n",
      "All of this, of course, would be ratcheted up considerably should any sign of serious disease develop.\n",
      "``They have two cases of St. Louis encephalitis in Florida,'' one entomologist said, not entirely in jest, ``and they dip the whole state in malathion.''\n",
      "Yet yellow fever or dengue, like malaria, is only a plane flight away from the United States.\n",
      "In the nightmare scenario, someone gets on a plane in, say, Sao Paulo infected with yellow fever but showing no symptoms and deplanes in Miami or any other city south of Atlanta, where Aedes aegypti is well established and can survive the winter.\n",
      "It is not nearly as unlikely as it may seem.\n",
      "``Last year,'' said Tom Monath, the former head of the CDC's insect-borne infectious-disease division, ``we had an unfortunate individual who went on a river trip in Brazil, got infected and came back and was hospitalized in Nashville and died at Vanderbilt.''\n",
      "All it takes is for an infected person to get bit by Aedes aegypti and the disease can begin to spread.\n",
      "It is a task for which this particular mosquito is exquisitely qualified.\n",
      "Eradication is the ultimate weapon against mosquitoes, but the immensity (not to say futility) of the effort is hard to comprehend.\n",
      "Despite all the scientific and technological advances of this past century, no one has improved on the method William Gorgas first applied in Havana in 1901.\n",
      "For centuries, Havana had been ravaged by yellow fever.\n",
      "Gorgas and his sanitation crews went house to house and building to building, getting rid of every potential mosquito breeding site for Aedes aegypti in the entire city.\n",
      "As Gorgas did it, the operation bordered on the paramilitary, which is the only way it has worked since then.\n",
      "In 1947, the Pan American Sanitary Bureau (predecessor of the Pan American Health Organization) decided that a hemisphere-wide eradication campaign was the only way to put an end to the urban yellow fever epidemics that still devastated Latin America.\n",
      "By 1962, at the peak of the program and with liberal use of DDT, 18 nations were officially free of Aedes aegypti.\n",
      "Three more nations eventually accomplished the feat, but there were some notable failures, in particular the United States, where the mosquito infested virtually every southern state.\n",
      "The failure of the program was as much political as scientific.\n",
      "Mosquito-control experts complained at the time that Congress budgeted too little to accomplish the task.\n",
      "Donald Schliessmann, who directed the CDC's efforts, described the allocation as ``equivalent to instructions to fly across the Atlantic with half a tank of gas.''\n",
      "With such tepid support in the United States, the Pan American Health Organization's eradication program promptly died and the mosquito had little trouble recolonizing its former haunts.\n",
      "Its return has inevitably been followed by the return of dengue fever, which has experts at the CDC and PAHO worried for three distinct reasons.\n",
      "First, unlike the case of yellow fever, there is no vaccine for dengue, which means that the only defense for locals or travelers, as one CDC entomologist bluntly put it, is not to get bit.\n",
      "Second, dengue epidemics are explosive.\n",
      "``The first time a country has an epidemic, it is usually in the capital city, and you can have 30 to 60 percent of the people all sick at the same time,'' Mike Nelson, a PAHO entomologist, informed me.\n",
      "A 1986-87 epidemic in Rio de Janeiro tallied one million cases.\n",
      "In 1988, dengue hit Guayaquil, Ecuador, with some 450,000 cases in four months.\n",
      "Most troubling to PAHO experts is the potentially fatal hemorrhagic manifestation of dengue.\n",
      "Researchers have identified four separate ``serotypes,'' or variants, of the dengue virus (known, unimaginatively, as dengue-1 through dengue-4).\n",
      "A first infection can bring on dengue fever.\n",
      "Subsequent infections with other serotypes are then likely to produce dengue hemorrhagic fever, which can lead to massive hemorrhaging or circulatory collapse.\n",
      "The first major appearance of dengue hemorrhagic fever in the Western Hemisphere occurred in 1981 during a Cuban epidemic: There were 300,000 cases of dengue and 10,000 cases of hemorrhagic fever with 158 deaths.\n",
      "Smaller outbreaks of dengue hemorrhagic fever appeared in Venezuela in 1989-90 and in Rio de Janeiro in 1990.\n",
      "The numbers have been climbing steadily.\n",
      "In Mexico, for example, there were 26 reported cases in the entire decade prior to 1994.\n",
      "In 1994 alone there were 30 cases, and in 1995 there were 92.\n",
      "To date, the problem in this hemisphere is predominantly a Latin American one, and is likely to remain so, but experts predict that the numbers of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever cases will continue to grow.\n",
      "Meanwhile, urban yellow fever is a ``modern-day time bomb,'' Gubler said.\n",
      "``We're just sitting here waiting for it to happen.''\n",
      "With all the renewed concern, the Pan American Health Organization is once again talking about eradication _ or, rather, what it calls ``amplification and intensification of combat.''\n",
      "PAHO officials met in April in Caracas and came up with a five-step plan.\n",
      "Each step, if approved, will successively lower the infestation levels until transmission of the disease is entirely interrupted.\n",
      "Only then will they go on to eradication, if it is necessary and considered remotely possible.\n",
      "While PAHO is leaving the door open for eradication, none of the entomologists with whom I spoke believe it is still possible.\n",
      "Between the garbage of modern times and the ease of reinfestation, they suggested, the job has probably become undoable at any cost.\n",
      "``There was probably a chance to eradicate Aedes aegypti in the '40s, '50s and '60s,'' said Tom Monath, the former CDC official.\n",
      "``But at this point in time, the war is lost.''\n",
      "If the small town of Florida is any indication, it is easy to understand why the smart money is on mosquitoes.\n",
      "Reiter took me on a tour through one neighborhood _ no shantytown but a middle-class housing development.\n",
      "Most of the homes were brightly painted, with nice Japanese and American cars in the carports.\n",
      "We went climbing through backyards, looking in carports, peering amid the tropical flowers, looking for breeding sites.\n",
      "They weren't hard to find.\n",
      "It was in a carport that I saw my first mosquito larvae.\n",
      "Reiter had to point them out to me.\n",
      "All I saw was an empty plastic SAE-40 oil bottle floating in five inches of water, along with a few rubber balls and an orange plastic Halloween pumpkin.\n",
      "Finally, Reiter directed my attention to the larvae, which were nearly invisible, S-shaped, thin and brown and flitting frenetically.\n",
      "Their nontechnical name is ``wrigglers,'' and that's exactly what they were doing.\n",
      "In a children's plastic wading pool.\n",
      "In the two hours I spent with Reiter and his colleagues, in a locale where every breeding site had been eliminated two months earlier, we found 23 newly infected breeding sites scattered among 16 houses.\n",
      "We found Aedes aegypti larvae in children's toys and soda cans, plastic cups and discarded automobile tires.\n",
      "We also found pupae, the next step up in mosquito development.\n",
      "In two or three days, Reiter pointed out, they would emerge as adults.\n",
      "``We're looking at something like 5 mosquitoes per human,'' he said, ``maybe 20 female mosquitoes per home.''\n",
      "The numbers have been debated, but for a viable epidemic, one infected breeding site in those 16 houses would have been more than enough.\n",
      "The implications are obvious.\n",
      "``Where you have successful control,'' Reiter said, ``and then you cease and you have a population that's largely susceptible, then you can have a rip-roaring epidemic and perhaps terrible tragedy.''\n",
      "``Is it possible to eradicate this species?''\n",
      "Reiter asked me rhetorically.\n",
      "``How can you possibly imagine you can eradicate a species as successful as aegypti?\n",
      "You could eradicate smallpox, because you eliminated its environment by vaccinating people.\n",
      "So that in the end there wasn't any habitat for the virus.\n",
      "But there's habitat for Aedes aegypti every time it rains.''\n",

      "She has small wings and fernlike antennae.\n",
      "Her Latin name is Aedes aegypti.\n",
      "As with all mosquitoes, only the female bites you.\n",
      "Nothing personal: She simply requires protein to produce her eggs and has evolved the equipment to procure it from your blood.\n",
      "Males live exclusively on nectar.\n",
      "Upon landing, she probes for a blood vessel, inserting her mouthparts into your skin a millimeter or two at a time, lubricating the motion with saliva, then pulling them back out.\n",
      "The motion is oddly reminiscent of fly-fishing, of dipping the rod in a cast and bringing it back.\n",
      "When she finds a blood vessel, she forces the tip of her proboscis through the skin and into the flow of the blood.\n",
      "She then simultaneously sucks out blood while continuing to dribble saliva.\n",
      "The walls of her proboscis are double-barreled, so saliva dribbles down one barrel while the blood is imbibed through the other.\n",
      "If she happens to be infected with a virus or a parasite, it will pass by way of the saliva to you.\n",
      "The bite is painless.\n",
      "If you are allergic to the saliva, the itching begins in about a minute, but the mosquito will probably be gone by then.\n",
      "If you are not allergic, you may never know you've been had.\n",
      "Aedes aegypti has evolved to bite you and get away alive.\n",
      "It is precisely that bite, and its implications for human disease, that prompted Paul Reiter, an entomologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to visit the central highlands of Puerto Rico several months ago.\n",
      "Reiter picked me up at my hotel at 6:30 on an already muggy morning to beat the rush-hour traffic out of San Juan, which we failed to do.\n",
      "We were headed for Florida, a small town about an hour's drive west of the capital.\n",
      "The CDC runs a laboratory in San Juan to keep track of Aedes aegypti and the diseases it causes, and there has been a lot to keep track of lately.\n",
      "The mosquito, long a bane in the Western hemisphere, has made a stealthy and disturbing comeback.\n",
      "For 200 years this one species brought devastating epidemics of urban yellow fever to the Americas, including significant outbreaks in New York and Philadelphia.\n",
      "The mosquito is also responsible for infecting about 100 million people each year with dengue (pronounced DEN-gee) fever, a severe flulike illness whose common name _ breakbone fever _ adverts to its excruciating pain.\n",
      "It infects another 200,000 to 500,000 people with dengue hemorrhagic fever, a potentially fatal form of dengue.\n",
      "To epidemiologists, the presence of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever is a harbinger of urban yellow-fever outbreaks to come.\n",
      "Dengue fever is now a constant presence in Puerto Rico, with occasional epidemic flare-ups.\n",
      "A small dengue epidemic swept through the town of Florida in 1991.\n",

      "Four had hemorrhagic fever, and one of those died.\n",
      "Reiter was making a series of visits to the town as part of an experiment to see if it were possible to block the dangerous traffic among viruses, mosquitoes and humans.\n",
      "As we drove out, Reiter, wearing a blue ``CDC at 50'' T-shirt, his curly brown hair in disarray, explained the gist of the mosquito problem, which was not, as you might think, that the insect has become better adapted to the modern world, but rather that the world has become much more accommodating to the mosquito.\n",
      "Aedes aegypti is a mosquito that has evolved to live in proximity to humans and to breed almost exclusively in man-made containers capable of holding stagnant water.\n",
      "Thus the detritus of late-20th-century civilization, all the junk and discards and certifiably nonbiodegradable material that have been liberally strewn throughout the world, now constitutes the ideal breeding site for the mosquito.\n",
      "While mankind has driven thousands of species on this planet toward extinction by destroying their habitats, there are a few, such as Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae, the primary carrier (or ``vector'') of malaria, for which we have done nothing but provide new habitats.\n",
      "If anything, we may have created a severe public-health crisis in the tropics.\n",

      "It begins with the bite.\n",
      "She alights on your skin, a small, elegant, grayish mosquito with a distinctive, silvery-white lyre-shaped pattern on her back.\n",
      "She has small wings and fernlike antennae.\n",
      "Her Latin name is Aedes aegypti.\n",
      "As with all mosquitoes, only the female bites you.\n",
      "Nothing personal: She simply requires protein to produce her eggs and has evolved the equipment to procure it from your blood.\n",
      "Males live exclusively on nectar.\n",
      "Upon landing, she probes for a blood vessel, inserting her mouthparts into your skin a millimeter or two at a time, lubricating the motion with saliva, then pulling them back out.\n",
      "The motion is oddly reminiscent of fly-fishing, of dipping the rod in a cast and bringing it back.\n",
      "When she finds a blood vessel, she forces the tip of her proboscis through the skin and into the flow of the blood.\n",
      "She then simultaneously sucks out blood while continuing to dribble saliva.\n",
      "The walls of her proboscis are double-barreled, so saliva dribbles down one barrel while the blood is imbibed through the other.\n",
      "If she happens to be infected with a virus or a parasite, it will pass by way of the saliva to you.\n",
      "The bite is painless.\n",
      "If you are allergic to the saliva, the itching begins in about a minute, but the mosquito will probably be gone by then.\n",
      "If you are not allergic, you may never know you've been had.\n",
      "Aedes aegypti has evolved to bite you and get away alive.\n",
      "It is precisely that bite, and its implications for human disease, that prompted Paul Reiter, an entomologist with the Centers for Disease Control ad Prevention, to visit the central highlands of Puerto Rico several months ago.\n",
      "Reiter picked me up at my hotel at 6:30 on an already muggy morning to beat the rush-hour traffic out of San Juan, which we failed to do.\n",
      "We were headed for Florida, a small town about an hour's drive west of the capital.\n",
      "The CDC runs a laboratory in San Juan to keep track of Aedes aegypti and the diseases it causes, and there has been a lot to keep track of lately.\n",
      "The mosquito, long a bane in the Western hemisphere, has made a stealthy and disturbing comeback.\n",
      "For 200 years this one species brought devastating epidemics of urban yellow fever to the Americas, including significant outbreaks in New York and Philadelphia.\n",
      "The mosquito is also responsible for infecting about 100 million people each year with dengue (pronounced DEN-gee) fever, a severe flulike illness whose common name _ breakbone fever _ adverts to its excruciating pain.\n",
      "It infects another 200,000 to 500,000 people with dengue hemorrhagic fever, a potentially fatal form of dengue.\n",
      "To epidemiologists, the presence of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever is a harbinger of urban yellow-fever outbreaks to come.\n",
      "Dengue fever is now a constant presence in Puerto Rico, with occasional epidemic flare-ups.\n",
      "A small dengue epidemic swept through the town of Florida in 1991.\n",
      "Among its 8,900 inhabitants, 400 had been sick enough to need medical attention.\n",
      "Four had hemorrhagic fever, and one of those died.\n",
      "Reiter was making a series of visits to the town as part of an experiment to see if it were possible to block the dangerous traffic among viruses, mosquitoes and humans.\n",
      "As we drove out, Reiter, wearing a blue ``CDC at 50'' T-shirt, his curly brown hair in disarray, explained the gist of the mosquito problem, which was not, as you might think, that the insect has become better adapted to the modern world, but rather that the world has become much more accommodating to the mosquito.\n",
      "Aedes aegypti is a mosquito that has evolved to live in proximity to humans and to breed almost exclusively in man-made containers capable of holding stagnant water.\n",
      "Thus the detritus of late-20th-century civilization, all the junk and discards and certifiably nonbiodegradable material that have been liberally strewn throughout the world, now constitutes the ideal breeding site for the mosquito.\n",
      "While mankind has driven thousands of species on this planet toward extinction by destroying their habitats, there are a few, such as Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae, the primary carrier (or ``vector'') of malaria, for which we have done nothing but provide new habitats.\n",
      "If anything, we may have created a severe public-health crisis in the tropics.\n",
      "Despite a decades-long campaign to eradicate Aedes aegypti in this hemisphere, the mosquito has recolonized virtually every acre of its former breeding grounds.\n",
      "Of the 21 countries declared free of the mosquito in the 1960s, every last one has now become reinfested.\n",
      "What makes this especially significant is what Reiter calls the catch-22 of mosquito eradication.\n",
      "Once you embark upon it, you can never stop, or the threat to public health actually gets worse.\n",
      "The reason is an unfortunate variable known to epidemiologists as ``herd immunity'' _ the proportion of the population that has become immune to a virus such as dengue.\n",
      "Not everyone infected by the virus gets dengue symptoms, but everyone who has been infected develops immunity to the virus, and when a mosquito bites one of those people, it wastes precious bites that could otherwise be spreading the disease.\n",
      "This dilutes the force of the epidemic and eventually kills it off, since most of the populace becomes immune.\n",
      "The higher the herd immunity, the more mosquitoes necessary to start an epidemic.\n",
      "The lower the immunity, the fewer mosquitoes.\n",
      "Given the realities of herd immunity, you could argue that the worst possible public-health situation would be to eradicate a mosquito such as Aedes aegypti and then let it return.\n",
      "That is precisely what has happened in the Western hemisphere, and among the people who know it best, this particular insect is a formidable foe.\n",
      "``It's quite astonishing how resourceful the mosquito is,'' Reiter said, with a little wonder in his voice.\n",
      "From the human perspective, the insects (there are more than 3,000 species in the world) fall into two crude categories _ mere pests and real menaces _ and much of the distinction depends on where you live.\n",
      "Those of us who live in temperate climes deal with the mosquito as an annoyance, although the bother would be nearly unbearable were it not for prodigious amounts of mosquito control.\n",
      "Most of the state of Florida would be uninhabitable by modern standards without control measures, and so, for instance, would the south shore of Long Island or much of New Jersey, which earlier in the century was known unaffectionately as the ``Mosquito State.''\n",
      "In more tropical regions, the mosquito is considerably more than a nuisance.\n",
      "The danger is real and getting worse after several decades of ill-conceived eradication campaigns.\n",
      "While the diseases that make headlines these days are the freakish ``emerging'' viruses _ the hantavirus outbreak that killed 27 people in the Southwest in 1993 or the rare Ebola that killed 245 in 1995 in one small corner of the former Zaire _ mosquitoes transmit disease to at least 700 million people each year, about one-eighth of the world's population, and cause almost 3 million fatalities.\n",
      "In its World Health Report 1996, the World Health Organization labeled the mosquito the ``greatest menace'' of all disease-transmitting insects.\n",
      "Even that may understate the problem.\n",
      "Mosquitoes will kill, by WHO tally, roughly 1 in every 17 people currently alive on this planet.\n",
      "Perhaps 400 species of mosquito can transmit disease to humans.\n",
      "Malaria, for example, is carried by mosquitoes of the Anopheles family, of which some 60 species are reasonably competent vectors.\n",
      "One mosquito known colloquially as ``quinks'' (for Culex quinquefasciatus), which breeds in pit latrines, drainage ditches and any polluted water, spreads the filariasis worm that infects more than 100 million people, primarily in South Asia, the Pacific Islands and Africa.\n",
      "The parasite can cause either elephantiasis, in which the limbs become grossly swollen, or hydrocoele, in which the scrotum enlarges to gruesome proportions.\n",
      "Several species common to North America, including Culex tarsalis, transmit encephalitis viruses in the United States.\n",
      "These viruses _ in particular La Crosse encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis and Eastern and Western equine encephalitis _ circulate unseen in forest settings, passed between sylvan mosquitoes and the local birds or rodents, but they occasionally cause serious disease in children.\n",
      "A few dozen cases are reported each year to the CDC, with outbreaks every decade or so.\n",
      "In 1990, 250 people in Florida were struck with St. Louis encephalitis and 25 died.\n",
      "``The general perception is that mosquito-borne diseases ought to be eradicable,'' said Harold Varmus, director of the National Institutes of Health, ``and they have not proven to be so.\n",
      "And not only have the mosquitoes not been eradicated, but some of these diseases they carry are resurgent.\n",
      "They have come back from a fairly low ebb.''\n",
      "In response to this rebounding threat to public health, the National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization are planning a long-range research effort, while the World Bank is seeking support for a 30-year plan to battle malaria, but the obstacles strike many as nearly insurmountable.\n",
      "An effective malaria vaccine, long a goal, seems years away, and no one talks about trying to eliminate malaria-carrying mosquitoes anymore.\n",
      "Like Aedes aegypti, the Anopheles mosquito rapidly developed resistance to insecticides like DDT.\n",
      "Eradication, as one World Bank official said, ``has become a dirty word.''\n",
      "Aedes aegypti, meanwhile, has returned in a big way to this hemisphere, and brought disease back with it.\n",
      "Dengue is once again well-established throughout Latin America, and the number of cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever is creeping upward.\n",
      "The year 1995 was the worst on record for dengue fever in the Americas, and this summer there have already been epidemics in Mexico and Cuba.\n",
      "And while there haven't been epidemics of yellow fever in cities in this hemisphere in 50 years, tropical-disease experts are not so much warning of imminent outbreaks as wondering why they haven't yet occurred in places such as Caracas or Cali.\n",
      "``We now have in the American tropics several hundred million people who are susceptible to yellow fever,'' said Duane Gubler, who is the director of the division of vector-borne infectious diseases of the CDC.\n",
      "``All these areas are infested with Aedes aegypti, and so we're at the highest risk in over 50 years for urban epidemics of yellow fever.\n",
      "Once urban transmission begins in the American region, it's probably going to spread very rapidly throughout the region to other urban centers and then from there to Asia and the Pacific.''\n",
      "Yellow fever, sometimes known as the ``American plague,'' begins with fits of shivering, fever and thirst, rapidly progressing to furious headaches and joint pain and finally jaundice _ whence the ``yellow'' of its name.\n",
      "Despite the existence of a vaccine for yellow fever, public-health experts such as Gubler doubt that there is enough to handle an epidemic or that it could be distributed swiftly enough to blunt an outbreak.\n",
      "The odds of such an epidemic coming ``onshore,'' as experts refer to an outbreak in the United States, is considered remote.\n",
      "State and local governments spend roughly $200 million a year on mosquito control.\n",

      "In a children's plastic wading pool.\n",
      "In the two hours I spent with Reiter and his colleagues, in a locale where every breeding site had been eliminated two months earlier, we found 23 newly infected breeding sites scattered among 16 houses.\n",
      "We found Aedes aegypti larvae in children's toys and soda cans, plastic cups and discarded automobile tires.\n",
      "We also found pupae, the next step up in mosquito development.\n",
      "In two or three days, Reiter pointed out, they would emerge as adults.\n",
      "``We're looking at something like 5 mosquitoes per human,'' he said, ``maybe 20 female mosquitoes per home.''\n",
      "The numbers have been debated, but for a viable epidemic, one infected breeding site in those 16 houses would have been more than enough.\n",
      "The implications are obvious.\n",
      "``Where you have successful control,'' Reiter said, ``and then you cease and you have a population that's largely susceptible, then you can have a rip-roaring epidemic and perhaps terrible tragedy.''\n",
      "``Is it possible to eradicate this species?''\n",
      "Reiter asked me rhetorically.\n",
      "``How can you possibly imagine you can eradicate a species as successful as aegypti?\n",
      "You could eradicate smallpox, because you eliminated its environment by vaccinating people.\n",
      "So that in the end there wasn't any habitat for the virus.\n",

      "There is no evidence to support the explosive theory that careless American polio researchers set off the worldwide AIDS epidemic by transferring the virus from chimpanzees to humans in the 1950s, according to four studies to be published Friday.\n",
      "How the deadly virus made its way from its chimpanzee origins into the human bloodstream is among modern medicine's most troubling mysteries.\n",
      "Mainstream theory holds that central Africans were infected by hunting or eating chimpanzees, then spread the virus as the region became crowded with cities and roads.\n",
      "The evidence however is largely circumstantial, and has left the door open to more controversial theories, from AIDS as a genocidal plot by white scientists to a divine revenge for wanton behavior.\n",
      "Scientists say a definitive answer to AIDS' origins could prevent a similar calamity in the future.\n",
      "The alternative theory with the most traction _ US doctors fed Africans HIV-contaminated polio vaccine _ was popularized by crusading British writer Edward Hooper in the 1999 book ``The River.''\n",
      "The four papers that will appear Friday are a direct response to the book.\n",
      "In them, scientists working separately in Germany, France and England analyzed most of the batches of the actual 1950s polio vaccine, which had been preserved.\n",
      "They found no traces of chimpanzee DNA or HIV.\n",
      "Preliminary results of the papers were aired at a conference in London last winter but this week editors at the world's two most prestigious scientific journals, Nature and Science, decided to simultaneously publish the results hoping to deliver a death blow to Hooper's theory, said editors at the publications.\n",
      "However, since a small portion of the polio vaccine used in the 1950s was not saved, and cannot ever be tested, Hooper's thesis is likely to persist much like theories about President John F. Kennedy's assassination, said researchers.\n",
      "Hooper was travelling in Africa and could not be reached for comment, said his literary agent.\n",
      "One of the scientists involved in the refutation effort said the conclusions in Friday's papers definitively rule out the possibility that existing samples of the 1950s polio vaccine contain HIV or chimpanzee DNA.\n",
      "``I feel confident that we have done everything we can to detect chimp DNA in this sample, so as far as I can see there is not much more one can presently do in order to clarify the situation further,'' said Svante Paabo, a genetics professor at the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig, Germany.\n",
      "Scientists at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, the non-profit research center that created and distributed the suspected batches of polio vaccine, expressed relief _ and vindication _ at the results.\n",
      "For two years, their employees had been accused by some of causing one of the worst plagues in human history, noted Clayton Buck, Wistar's CEO.\n",
      "``The whole issue is now put to rest,'' he said.\n",
      "But the mystery surrounding the origin of AIDS is not.\n",
      "The first cases were identified in a handful of gay men in Los Angeles in 1981.\n",
      "Since then it has spread to more than 30 million people worldwide, and shows no signs of slowing.\n",
      "In 1984, international research teams idenified the cause of AIDS, a virus dubbed the human immunodeficiency virus or HIV.\n",
      "But in 1985 came an odd discovery.\n",
      "Asian monkeys housed in US labs were dying AIDS-like deaths.\n",
      "Researchers found the culprit was a virus strikingly similar to HIV.\n",
      "They called it SIV or simian immunodeficiency virus, and its origins could be traced to a species of monkey called the sooty mangabey found only a narrow tract of land in west Africa.\n",
      "Based on additional research, scientists determined that the first human AIDS cases actually occured in central western Africa in the 1950s.\n",
      "Genetic detective work found that the strains of the AIDS virus infecting humans worldwide evolved from SIV-infected African chimpanzees and sooty mangabeys.\n",
      "But SIV turned out to be a weak virus that has great difficulty in making the jump from primates to humans.\n",
      "A mystery was born: How did the jump occur?\n",
      "Scientists speculated that an African hunter absorbed the blood of an infected chimp.\n",
      "And there was another nagging question: given that SIV is likely centuries old, why did it wait until the 1950s to make the jump into humans?\n",
      "There were no definitive answers.\n",
      "Into this vaccum stepped Edward Hooper, a former BBC reporter long fascinated with AIDS.\n",
      "In his researches, he found that the Wistar Institute had used chimpanzees in its polio research in Africa in the 1950s.\n",
      "At the time, Wistar scientists, working in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, were testing an experimental oral vaccine for polio made using monkey cells.\n",
      "They gave it to about one million Africans.\n",
      "Hooper found that 47 of the 51 HIV-positive blood samples collected in Africa before 1981 came from villages where Wistar tested its polio vaccine.\n",
      "He theorized that Wistar inadvertently added infected chimp cells to the monkey cells in their vaccine, thus spreading the disease to humans.\n",
      "From this came his 1,000-page book ``The River.''\n",
      "Following its well-publicized release, scientists rushed to test all the existing samples of the accused Wistar vaccine.\n",
      "Most of it had been preserved, though a small portion was lost years ago.\n",
      "The results, to be published Friday, are that the batches are free of chimpanzee DNA and HIV.\n",
      "Last year, when the results were first aired, Hooper argued that the lost batches of vaccine could hold the answer.\n",
      "But mainstream scientists appear, for the moment, satisfied with this week's results.\n",
      "``For people who are actually trying to weigh the evidence, these data will go a long way in laying to rest the controversy,'' said Katrina Kelner, deputy managing editor of Science.\n",

      "``There are so many rituals going into the lab that it gives you a great deal of respect for the virus,'' said Damon, a leader of CDC's smallpox research effort.\n",
      "Smallpox virus has been stored at the CDC since the disease was eradicated in the 1970s.\n",
      "CDC scientists took the virus from the freezer several years ago, racing to learn as much as possible about it before the World Health Organization destroyed the stockpile at the end of this year.\n",
      "On Thursday, the virus and the CDC got a reprieve: The WHO's Executive Board voted to postpone destruction indefinitely.\n",
      "Terrorist threat The stay of execution is based on fears that terrorists have the virus and might use it as a weapon: Most vaccinations against smallpox ended 20 years ago, and much of the world's population is vulnerable to it.\n",
      "The possibility of terrorism gives fresh urgency to a CDC research program that already has been working at a rapid pace.\n",
      "``This started well before September 11,'' said Dr. James LeDuc, director of the smallpox research program.\n",
      "``I think its value is just now being appreciated.''\n",
      "The CDC is one of two institutions in the world where samples of the virus, called variola, were preserved by WHO.\n",
      "The other is in Novosibirsk, Russia.\n",
      "The collections _ 461 isolates here, and 161 in the Russian lab _ hold samples from dozens of countries: CDC's freezer contains varieties from Bangladesh, South Africa, Somalia and Britain, among others.\n",
      "The WHO intended for both collections to be destroyed.\n",
      "Twice, variola has been reprieved.\n",
      "Its first execution date was mid-1999, until the WHO realized that new lab science methods could yield more information about the virus and pushed final destruction to the end of 2002.\n",
      "That launched the CDC's orthopox group _ 13 scientists who work with smallpox and its genetic cousins _ on an all-out effort to glean as much knowledge as possible before the deadline.\n",
      "``It is a seven-days-a-week schedule,'' said Damon, chief of the poxvirus section.\n",
      "``I don't see that it can get much faster than it is already and still make sure experiments are done well and we are asking the appropriate questions.''\n",
      "The smallpox research includes scientists from the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense, but all work takes place at the CDC's headquarters, in the biosafety suites at the heart of the Clifton Road campus.\n",
      "That presumably is the home of the frozen virus collection: The CDC will not discuss its location nor allow the lab or freezer to be photographed.\n",
      "The smallpox research has several goals: mapping the variola genome, creating lab diagnostic tests for smallpox and finding drugs for treatment if the disease returns.\n",
      "Those would all be achievements in basic science, but in the new era, they represent practical defenses as well.\n",
      "``The defensive mode was always in people's minds, but it was never the real justification for this,'' LeDuc said.\n",
      "``Today that has all changed.\n",
      "The intelligence community is very much interested in the work we are doing.''\n",
      "Mapping the variola genome, for instance, adds new knowledge to smallpox science.\n",
      "But it also allows the CDC to build a detailed database of variola's genetic fingerprints, a tool that could help identify the strain being used if the virus were deployed as a weapon or pinpoint whether it had been genetically altered to be more virulent.\n",
      "The genetic map also allows the CDC to check the integrity of its virus collection.\n",
      "The stockpile includes dried scabs that fall from smallpox lesions.\n",
      "Other sections of it contain multiple generations of the virus grown in culture, a process that can allow errors to creep in.\n",
      "New techniques Knowing which strains are pure serves the CDC's other research goals.\n",
      "Smallpox diagnosis and treatment did not change for more than 20 years, because they did not have to _ but laboratory science did.\n",
      "Techniques now exist that could allow the disease to be rapidly diagnosed by both genetic analysis of the virus and examination of a patient's immune reaction.\n",
      "There have been similar changes in treatment.\n",
      "Antibiotics are useless against smallpox because it is a viral disease, so treatment for victims before eradication consisted mostly of making patients comfortable and protecting others from them.\n",
      "But the advent of AIDS after smallpox was eradicated spurred the rapid development of anti-viral drugs.\n",
      "So far, one anti-AIDS drug, cidofovir, appears to be useful against variola.\n",
      "But it can be toxic and would be difficult to administer to large numbers of patients at once, so the CDC is looking for additional candidates.\n",
      "``The goal is to have two fully licensed anti-virals so that resistance against the drugs would not evolve biologically and would be difficult to engineer,'' LeDuc said.\n",
      "The search for smallpox diagnostic techniques and treatments has faced one significant obstacle: There are no cases of the disease to test them against.\n",
      "That leaves researchers with only virus grown in culture as a testing ground _ unsatisfying, because drugs must be successfully tested in humans to pass regulation by the Food and Drug Administration.\n",
      "The solution has been a scientific achievement, although it is likely to prove controversial.\n",
      "CDC scientists have created what is called an ``animal model'' of the disease by infecting rhesus macaque monkeys housed in the high-biosafety suites with smallpox.\n",
      "``It is not completely analogous to human disease,'' LeDuc said.\n",
      "``We need to refine it over the next course of experiments.\n",
      "But it is an important tool that allows us to evaluate in a living animal whether these drugs work.''\n",
      "The animal research should allow the CDC to test new smallpox vaccines as well.\n",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson has committed the Bush administration to acquiring 300 million doses of vaccine.\n",
      "Only 15.4 million now exist, although they could be used to protect 77 million people if research on dilution proves successful.\n",
      "But the current vaccine is dangerous for those with AIDS, cancer and organ transplants.\n",
      "There were few such patients in the population in the 1970s, but there are many now.\n",
      "Beyond specific scientific goals, the CDC smallpox research program has a larger agenda: to spread reassurance about the disease.\n",
      "``One of the messages we are trying to get out is to demystify smallpox,'' LeDuc said.\n",
      "``It would be a devastating event.\n",
      "But on the other hand, as a global society we have seen smallpox before, we have controlled it, we eliminated it from the world.\n",
      "It is not a great unknown.''\n",

      "Is AIDS a disaster inadvertently brought on by humans that arose from early testing of a polio vaccine in Africa in the 1950's?\n",
      "This provocative theory seemed far-fetched when it first came to public attention in an article in Rolling Stone in 1992.\n",
      "Most AIDS experts dismissed it after a scientific committee reviewed the theory and deemed the probability very low.\n",
      "But that panel based its conclusion in part on a published finding that was later shown to be in error.\n",
      "Now a remarkable new book by a British journalist offers tantalizing clues to revive and expand the polio vaccine theory.\n",
      "In ``The River'' (Little, Brown, $35), Edward Hooper suggests that an experimental oral polio vaccine might have been made with chimpanzee tissue contaminated with an ancestor of the virus that was to cause AIDS.\n",
      "Although he has no medical expertise, Hooper, 48, has done a prodigious amount of research since 1990.\n",
      "In 1,070 pages, including extensive footnotes, he builds a case based entirely on circumstantial evidence that he accumulated in hundreds of interviews and exhaustive library research.\n",
      "He finds close coincidence in both time and place between the earliest cases of AIDS and the testing of an oral vaccine developed at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia and, later, in two laboratories in Belgium.\n",
      "From 1957 to 1960, the vaccine was given to a million people in what are now Rwanda, Burundi and Congo.\n",
      "If the experimental vaccine was contaminated, nothing could have been done about it because tests for the ancestor virus did not exist then.\n",
      "And it would have been a one-time event because standard polio vaccines were not made from chimpanzee tissues.\n",
      "Of 28 cases of AIDS acquired in specified towns in Africa through 1980, 23 were from the same towns where the experimental vaccine was given or within 175 miles of them.\n",
      "The area is the epicenter of the African epidemic, which is the worst in the world.\n",
      "There is precedent for a simian virus' lurking in polio vaccine: millions of Americans were inadvertently infected with such a virus, SV-40, in the 1950's and early 1960's.\n",
      "(Fortunately, it was not harmful.)\n",
      "But in 1967, several laboratory workers in Germany died from the newly discovered Marburg virus after it had been imported in African green monkeys.\n",
      "The virus is harmless for the monkeys but lethal for humans.\n",
      "The similarities Hooper describes could be coincidence.\n",
      "``The River'' does not prove his extraordinary theory, nor does it claim to.\n",
      "But it builds a sufficiently detailed case to require serious examination of his theory.\n",
      "Attempts to find answers require extensive research, and in the book and in subsequent interviews Hooper has offered a long list of suggestions, including laboratory testing of the small amounts of vaccine that still exist after having been stored for more than 40 years.\n",
      "Because the vaccine may have degraded over the decades, performing all the proposed research might still not determine whether it accidentally touched off the AIDS epidemic.\n",
      "Even if a simian virus turned up in the stored samples, it would not prove that it started the epidemic.\n",
      "Still, even if the vaccine thesis is disproved, Hooper's research has embarrassed scientists.\n",
      "He has found that leading researchers kept sloppy records and that prestigious peer-reviewed medical journals published reports that omitted crucial details.\n",
      "Despite a diligent search, Hooper could turn up no records of what primate tissues were used to prepare the first experimental polio vaccines, which were tested mostly in Africa but also in the United States and Europe.\n",
      "Though the government requires more record keeping today, scientists say there is ample room for improvement.\n",
      "With the exception of a negative review in the journal Nature, experts writing in scientific journals have praised Hooper's diligence and scholarship and the plausibility of the thesis, even if they are skeptical of it.\n",
      "In the journal Science, Dr. Robin A. Weiss, a leading virologist in London, wrote that Hooper had written the most exhaustive history of polio vaccine trials and early AIDS cases.\n",
      "The Wistar Institute, the first independent medical research center in the United States, appointed the 1992 panel to examine the theory that its vaccine might have touched off the AIDS epidemic.\n",
      "Now it says it is trying to find independent experts to do what they were unwilling to do seven years ago, when the panel recommended testing the remaining stocks of the experimental polio vaccine.\n",
      "One aim is to detect evidence of simian cousins of HIV-1, the virus responsible for the overwhelming majority of AIDS cases in the world.\n",
      "A second is to determine the primate species from which the vaccine was prepared.\n",
      "Ever since American doctors first recognized AIDS in 1981, the origin of the viral disease has been a mystery.\n",
      "Scientists have dismissed many theories, including those that held that the Central Intelligence Agency or KGB concocted it, because they lacked evidence or did not fit the facts.\n",
      "What is known is that the earliest documented HIV-1 infection is from 1959 in a man in Kinshasa in what was then the Belgian Congo, was later Zaire and is now Congo.\n",
      "Scientists generally agree that HIV-1 derives from a simian virus in chimpanzees.\n",
      "But the unanswered question is how the virus jumped to humans.\n",
      "The usual view is that passage must have occurred in blood-to-blood contact, like a bite or cut during the slaughter of chimpanzees.\n",
      "But humans have killed chimpanzees for centuries.\n",
      "So why did transmission not occur until the late 1950's?\n",
      "The conventional explanation cites the vast social changes that occurred after World War II: mass migration, urbanization and sexual freedom.\n",
      "Monkey cells were routinely used to make polio vaccines then and now.\n",
      "But Hooper theorizes that chimpanzees were also used to prepare the experimental polio vaccine.\n",
      "As circumstantial evidence, he points to a large colony of chimpanzees at the Lindi River in central Congo, where the primates were caught for research.\n",
      "(The river of the book's title is a metaphor for the search for the source of AIDS.)\n",
      "Only a small percentage of chimpanzees are believed to carry the HIV-1 ancestor virus.\n",
      "But if chimpanzee tissues sent to a laboratory in Philadelphia or Belgium were infected, they might have found their way into one or more batches of experimental polio vaccine, particularly the strain known as CHAT, prepared at the Wistar Institute.\n",
      "In such an event, HIV's simian ancestor might have grown in the batches of polio vaccine used in experimental trials only.\n",
      "When the vaccine was squirted into human mouths, the simian virus could have passed through a sore or ulcer and entered the bloodstream, subsequently to evolve into HIV-1.\n",
      "From there it would have been transmitted through sexual or blood-to-blood contact.\n",
      "Any contamination would have been accidental, because specific tests could not have been performed before 1985, when a simian counterpart of HIV was first isolated.\n",
      "Whether chimpanzee tissue was used should be easily confirmed or refuted by checking laboratory records and scientific journals.\n",
      "But Hooper said he could not find out precisely how the vaccine was made, and neither could the committee that the Wistar Institute appointed in 1992 to examine the theory.\n",
